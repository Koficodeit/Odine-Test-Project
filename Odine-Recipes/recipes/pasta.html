    <p>Pasta is a versatile and beloved staple in many cuisines, particularly Italian. Made from durum wheat semolina or flour mixed with water or eggs, pasta comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, each suited to different types of sauces and dishes. From long strands of spaghetti and flat ribbons of fettuccine to tubular penne and tiny orzo, pasta can be paired with rich, hearty sauces like marinara and Alfredo, or enjoyed in lighter preparations such as pesto and aglio e olio. Its adaptability and comforting taste make pasta a favorite for simple weeknight meals as well as elaborate gourmet creations.</p>
