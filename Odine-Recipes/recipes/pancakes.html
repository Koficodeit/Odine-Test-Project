    <p>Pancakes are a beloved breakfast staple, known for their fluffy texture and golden-brown exterior. Made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder, they are cooked on a griddle or frying pan until light and airy. Often served in stacks, pancakes can be enjoyed with a variety of toppings such as butter, syrup, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or nuts, making them endlessly customizable. Their comforting taste and versatility make pancakes a favorite morning treat, perfect for leisurely weekend breakfasts or special brunch gatherings.</p>
