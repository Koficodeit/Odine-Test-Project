    <p>Meatloaf is a classic comfort food that combines ground meat, typically beef or a mixture of meats, with breadcrumbs, eggs, and a blend of seasonings. Often shaped into a loaf and baked, meatloaf is known for its hearty and satisfying nature. It is commonly glazed with a tangy tomato-based sauce or a sweet ketchup topping that caramelizes as it cooks, adding a flavorful crust. Versatile and easy to prepare, meatloaf can be customized with various ingredients like onions, garlic, herbs, and even vegetables. Served hot from the oven, it is a beloved family meal that pairs well with mashed potatoes, vegetables, or a fresh salad.</p>
